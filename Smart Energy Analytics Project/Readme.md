# Smart Energy Analytics Project Summary

## Project Objective:
Understand the impact of grid imports and solar generation on total energy consumption.
The Smart Energy Analytics BI project analyzes energy consumption trends across industries, homes, and public sectors while also predicting total energy consumption for the region.

## Data Source:
Open Power System Data, KN, Germany (2015-2019)

Three datasets were recorded by the source at 1-minute, 15-minute, and 60-minute intervals.
The dataset used for this project was recorded at 60-minute intervals.
The unpivoted dataset contains over 1.1 million energy consumption records from industries, public spaces, and residences in Konstanz, Germany.

## Analytics Procedure:
Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query in Power BI.
The entire user-centric BI report was built in Power BI, with the background designed in Figma.

Interactive featuressuch as navigation, a dynamic filter pane, and color-coded KPI indicators enhance user experience.
An additional feature used was Power BI's built-in forecasting, which predicts total energy consumption based on available data.

## Key Insights:
1. Grid imports accounted for 88.81% of total energy consumption.
2. Solar generation contributed to a 433.19M kg COâ‚‚ reduction over the study period.
3. Solar generation declined significantly in 2019.
4. Forecasted total energy consumption for 2024: ~867.75M kWh.

## Challenges: 
Data was limited to 2019, restricting long-term analysis.

## Next Steps:
1. Investigate cause of low solar power generation in 2019.
2. Validate forecasts with actual 2024 data.
3. Further analyze energy consumption per household equipments.
