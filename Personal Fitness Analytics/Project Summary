This is a Personal Fitness Analytics built with the data from my Google Fit through Google Takeout.

So what makes this project different from the others?
Aside it being personal, it is also different because of the use of more dynamic narratives for a better user experience.

The report is broken down into 3 pages which all track few but essential metrics on an overview, month year and year-to-date level.

For the next steps, I am learning how to extract data using Google Fit's API via Python for a better ETL process.
