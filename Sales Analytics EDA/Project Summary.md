## Tools & Libraries: 
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, VS Code.

## Analytics Procedure:
- Data cleaning to take care of unnecessary columns, duplicates, wrong data types, etc.
- Visualizations created for Regional and products profitability analysis, Month Sales vs Profit trend analysis, Sales distribution per Category analysis and an interactive scatter plot of Sales vs Profit.

## Key Insights:
- East & West were the most profitable regions.
- Technology is the most profitable category.
- Not all high sales contribute to high profit.

## Recommendation & Next Steps: 
- Investigate the reason why not all high sales contribute to high profit.
This might be a result pf high discounts.
- Consider creating an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash later.
